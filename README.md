# CS-255-DriverPass 

#### Summary 
This repository houses a business requirements document and a system design document that I have created to support a clients request to develop a system. 

#### Goal of the project: 
Design a system for the client, DriverPass, that will support driver training through online courses and practice tests. The system will also be utilize for scheduling services for on-the-road training with instructors. 

#### What I did well: 
I beleive that my ability to develop clear, clean and consise UML diagrams that can be leveraged in the development and creation of the system was an area that I exceled in when completing these effort. They allowed for easy exploration of the design and communication back to the client to ensure that all requirements for the system had been captured. 

#### What I wish I did different: 
While I believe that the requirements that I have identified are strong, I believe I currently lack the experience in the industry to have truly captured all of the requirements that could have been for this exercise. Looking back, I would wish to lean into others experiences and expertise when developing the requirements to capture insights from those that have developed these types of systems before and point out areas I could have missed. 

#### How did I gather the requirements: 
Utilizing in-person interview transcripts with the client, I dissected their requirements into functional needs. These were then translated into functional and non-functional requirements which I utilized to develop Use Case, Activity, and Sequence Diagrams for the system design. This is a very important process step when developing systems as the client requirements are what dictate the system and how it should be developed. By identifying their needs, we are able to plan out the system and ensure that its end functionality will successfully execute those requirements. If we are unable to capture those requirements in the beginning of the design process, additional work, delayed schedules, and possible over spending on the project can occur.  

#### What techniques I utilize when designing software: 
When approaching a system design, I lean heavily into requirements gathering. By ensuring that I have all the requirements upfront, I know I will have a successful design process. To do this, completing interviews with the client allow me to tease out those needs as well as identify needs that the client wasnâ€™t even aware of as they are formed from the other requirements they have set forth. Documentation is a close second in my approach. By having strong documentation and mapping, I am able to capture the needs required of the system to help me in the designing of it.
