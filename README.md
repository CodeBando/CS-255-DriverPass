# CS-255-DriverPass
#### Summary
This repository houses a business requirements document and a system design document that I have created to support a clients request to develop a system.

#### Goal of the project:
Design a system for the client, DriverPass, that will support driver training through online courses and practice tests. The system will also be utilize for scheduling services for on-the-road training with instructors. 

#### What I did well:
I beleive that my ability to develop clear, clean and consise UML diagrams that can be leveraged in the development and creation of the system was an area that I exceled in when completing these effort.

#### What I wish I did different:
While I believe that the requirements that I have identified are strong, I believe I currently lack the experience in the industry to have truly captured all of the requirements that could have been for this exercise.

#### How did I gather the requirements:
update

#### What techniques I utilize when designing software:
